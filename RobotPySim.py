RobotPySim (RPS) is a graphical cRIO and WPILib simulator for teams using Peter
Johnson's Python interpreter and utilities (github/robotpy) to program robots
for the FIRST Robotics Competiton (FRC). It is designed as a testing tool to
detect runtime errors and ensure correct behavior when deploying to a cRIO is
inconvenient. While it should be suitable for most robots as-is, the greatness
of WPILib and the cRIO is such that the author cannot repreduce it in full.
RPS is designed to be extensible, and teams are encouraged to write their own
implementations of obscure functions and submit them for inclusion in RPS
proper. The user should note that, while the author has tested RPS with real
code from Beach Cities Robotics 294's 2010 and 2011 robots, he does not have
access to a cRIO, and so code written first for RPS should not be trusted to
necessarily open any podbay doors.

The best part? RobotPySim is an in-place replacement of a cRIO. Robot code that
runs in RPS will run on a cRIO, and code that runs on a cRIO will not need to
be changed to run in RPS.
